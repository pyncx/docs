Following are the major techniques implemented

- **Analytical Solutions** : Manual implementation of condition of equilibrium and detailed balance.
- **Numerical Methods**:
    - **Simultaneous Ordinary Differential Equations**: Solving differential equation by implementation of numerical methods.
    - **Algebraic Method**: Translation of differential equations into an algebraic problem as linear equation of matrices and vector.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Random generation of states based on wighted probability distribution and calculation fraction of states at equilibrium.
